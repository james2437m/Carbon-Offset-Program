## Smart Contract Architecture

### Core Contracts

#### StorageVerificationContract
```solidity
// Validates and certifies battery installations
- registerStorage(address owner, StorageSpecs specs)
- verifyInstallation(uint256 storageId)
- updateCapacity(uint256 storageId, uint256 newCapacity)
- getStorageDetails(uint256 storageId)
```

#### CapacityAggregationContract
```solidity
// Manages distributed storage pooling
- joinPool(uint256 storageId, uint256 availableCapacity)
- leavePool(uint256 storageId)
- allocateCapacity(uint256 requiredCapacity)
- redistributeLoad(uint256[] storageIds)
```

#### GridServicesContract
```solidity
// Coordinates grid support services
- registerService(ServiceType service, uint256 capacity)
- executeService(uint256 serviceId, bytes calldata parameters)
- validateServiceDelivery(uint256 serviceId)
- settlePayments(uint256 serviceId)
```

#### RevenueOptimizationContract
```solidity
// Maximizes storage returns
- calculateOptimalBidding(MarketConditions conditions)
- distributeRevenue(uint256[] participants, uint256[] contributions)
- trackPerformanceMetrics(uint256 storageId)
- adjustPricingStrategy(uint256 poolId)
```

#### PerformanceAnalyticsContract
```solidity
// Tracks and analyzes system performance
- recordPerformanceData(uint256 storageId, PerformanceData data)
- generateAnalytics(uint256 timeframe)
- predictMaintenance(uint256 storageId)
- benchmarkEfficiency(uint256[] storageIds)
```

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16 or higher
- Ethereum development environment (Hardhat/Truffle)
- Web3 wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- IoT sensors for battery monitoring

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/blockchain-energy-storage
cd blockchain-energy-storage
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure environment**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your network and API keys
```

4. **Deploy contracts**
```bash
npx hardhat deploy --network mainnet
```

5. **Initialize monitoring**
```bash
npm run start-monitoring
```

## Usage Examples

### Register Storage Facility
```javascript
const storageContract = await ethers.getContractAt("StorageVerificationContract", contractAddress);

await storageContract.registerStorage(
  ownerAddress,
  {
    capacity: ethers.utils.parseEther("100"), // 100 kWh
    maxPower: ethers.utils.parseEther("50"),  // 50 kW
    efficiency: 95, // 95%
    location: "GPS_COORDINATES",
    batteryType: "LITHIUM_ION"
  }
);
```

### Join Aggregation Pool
```javascript
const aggregationContract = await ethers.getContractAt("CapacityAggregationContract", contractAddress);

await aggregationContract.joinPool(
  storageId,
  ethers.utils.parseEther("80") // 80 kWh available capacity
);
```

### Provide Grid Services
```javascript
const gridContract = await ethers.getContractAt("GridServicesContract", contractAddress);

await gridContract.registerService(
  "FREQUENCY_REGULATION",
  ethers.utils.parseEther("25") // 25 kW capacity
);
```

## Economic Model

### Revenue Streams
- **Energy arbitrage**: Buy low, sell high based on price differentials
- **Ancillary services**: Frequency regulation, spinning reserves
- **Capacity payments**: Availability compensation from grid operators
- **Demand response**: Peak load reduction incentives

### Cost Structure
- **Platform fees**: 2-5% of gross revenue
- **Transaction costs**: Gas fees for blockchain operations
- **Maintenance**: Automated through smart contract reserves
- **Insurance**: Pooled coverage for equipment protection
